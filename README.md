## Installation

### Prerequisites

Fotoh√§cker uses [Image](https://hexdocs.pm/image) for image upload compression, which in turn [requires libvips](https://hexdocs.pm/image/readme.html#installing-libvips). Refer to Images' documentation on how to install it.

### Setup

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install with `mix setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
